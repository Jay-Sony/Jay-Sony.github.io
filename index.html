            Newark Native and Programmer</span>
        <p>While attending high school, I spent my freshman and sophmore years as a member of my school's debate team. It wasn't until junior and senior year that I began taking computer science courses. These courses included intro to computer science and mobile app development where I developed a MVP(Minimum Viable Product) of a collaborative social media platform centered around memes of all kinds for all people. In the summer of my junior going on senior year, I attended All Star Code, a summer intensive centered around educating men of color on coding and computer programming. This six week program allowed me to gain and build upon my skills in javascript, html, and CSS. </p>
